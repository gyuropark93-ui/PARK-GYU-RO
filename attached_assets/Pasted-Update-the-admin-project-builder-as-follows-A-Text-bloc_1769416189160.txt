Update the admin project builder as follows:

A) Text block storage must use JSON (TipTap document)
- Use TipTap editor.
- Persist editor content as `project_blocks.data.text.json` (not HTML).
- Provide edit/preview toggle, but preview should render from the JSON.

B) Implement real drag-and-drop reordering for blocks on DESKTOP
Current issue:
- The UI shows a “grab” cursor but blocks do not actually reorder.

Requirements:
1) Use a modern, maintained drag library suitable for React:
   - Prefer @dnd-kit (core + sortable).
2) Only enable drag on desktop (pointer fine).
   - Keep mobile reordering as up/down buttons (already implemented).
3) Add a visible drag handle on each block (left side).
   - Drag starts ONLY from the handle, not from inside inputs/editors (avoid conflicts).
4) During dragging:
   - Show a placeholder / ghost preview.
   - Smooth animation on drop.
5) On drop:
   - Update local block order immediately (optimistic UI).
   - Recompute `sort_order` sequentially (e.g. 0..n-1).
   - Persist the new sort_order to Supabase using the existing `useReorderBlocks` mutation.
6) Ensure reordering works even when blocks contain:
   - TipTap editor
   - image upload buttons
   - inputs
   by preventing pointer capture issues and not attaching drag listeners to the full block container.

Implementation details (must-do):
- Use DndContext + SortableContext + useSortable per block.
- Use closestCenter collision detection.
- Provide sensors: PointerSensor with activationConstraint (distance: 8) to avoid accidental drags.
- Ensure each block has stable id keys: block.id.
- After reorder success, invalidate query ['project_blocks', projectId] as already done.

C) Fix pointer-events / z-index issues preventing drag
- Ensure the canvas container allows pointer interactions.
- Ensure no overlay/backdrop element is intercepting pointer events over the blocks.
- Drag handle must be above any block overlay with correct z-index.

Deliver:
- Working drag-and-drop reordering on desktop
- Mobile up/down reorder remains
- TipTap JSON persistence for text blocks
