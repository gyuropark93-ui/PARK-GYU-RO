Apply the following FINAL fixes and simplifications to the /admin CMS editor.
This prompt combines:
- Removing Draft/Published entirely
- Fixing block action buttons (delete/duplicate) disappearing
- Stabilizing block selection + outside-click deselect
- Keeping Behance-like UX and native mobile scrolling

DO NOT change the public site.

====================
1) REMOVE DRAFT / STATUS COMPLETELY
====================

UI:
- Remove the “Draft” pill/button from the admin top bar.
- Remove any Publish / Status UI.
- Top bar must contain ONLY:
  - Back button
  - Inline editable project title
  - Year selector
  - Unsaved/Saved indicator
  - Save button

Behavior:
- Saving immediately persists the project and reflects on the public site.
- No draft/published logic anywhere.

Code:
- Remove all references to:
  - status
  - draft
  - published
- Project creation insert must include ONLY existing required fields:
  - year
  - title = 'Untitled'
  - cover_url = null
- Save updates:
  - title
  - year
  - cover_url
  - updated_at
  - project_blocks (create/update/delete + sort_order)

Database:
- Ignore `projects.status` if it exists.
- Do NOT depend on it anywhere.

====================
2) FIX BLOCK ACTION BUTTONS (DELETE / DUPLICATE)
====================

Problem:
- Action buttons appear only right after creation.
- After clicking empty space, hovering the block again never shows actions.

Root cause:
- “Click outside to deselect” clears selection even when interacting with a block again.

Fix requirements:
- Keep “click empty space to deselect”.
- Ensure hovering or clicking a block again ALWAYS restores actions.

Implementation:

A) Block wrapper
- Wrap each block with a container that has:
  - data-block-id="{block.id}"
- The ENTIRE block card must be inside this wrapper.

B) Selection handling (robust)
- On the block wrapper:
  - Use onPointerDown to set selectedId = block.id
  - Ignore pointer events from:
    - buttons
    - inputs
    - textareas
    - contenteditable
    - drag handles

C) Hover behavior (desktop)
- On desktop (hover: hover):
  - onMouseEnter → set hoveredId = block.id
  - onMouseLeave → clear hoveredId
- Actions must show when:
  - hoveredId === block.id OR selectedId === block.id

D) Mobile behavior
- No hover logic.
- Actions show ONLY when selectedId === block.id.
- Touch interactions must not block scrolling.

E) Action visibility rules
- Desktop: show actions on hover OR selection.
- Mobile: show actions on selection only.
- Never rely on hover-only CSS.

====================
3) SAFE “CLICK OUTSIDE TO DESELECT”
====================

Implement ONE document-level pointerdown handler in the editor.

Rules:
- If pointerdown target is INSIDE:
  - a block wrapper ([data-block-id])
  - inspector panel ([data-inspector-panel])
  - bottom sheet ([data-bottom-sheet])
  → DO NOTHING.
- Otherwise:
  - setSelectedId(null)

Safety guards:
- Always check:
  - if (!(e.target instanceof Element)) return;
- Ensure the listener:
  - is added once
  - is cleaned up on unmount

This logic must NOT interfere with:
- block hover
- block re-selection
- delete/duplicate button clicks
- TipTap editing

====================
4) GRID SIMPLIFICATION (CONFIRMED)
====================

Keep ONLY uniform grid.

data.grid = {
  urls: string[],
  columnsDesktop: number,  // 2–4
  columnsMobile: number,   // 1–2
  gap: number
}

Remove completely:
- grid presets
- comparison modes
- highlight logic
- masonry
- any preset selector UI

Grid purpose:
- Group related images only.

====================
5) MOBILE SCROLLING (MUST NOT BREAK)
====================

Admin pages must scroll like a native feed (Instagram-like):

- Single scroll container (editor canvas)
- height: 100dvh
- overflow-y: auto
- -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch
- No global overflow:hidden
- No preventDefault on touchmove except on drag handles
- Bottom sheets must not steal scroll when closed

====================
6) GUARANTEES / ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
====================

After applying this:
- No Draft button anywhere.
- Save immediately persists project.
- Clicking empty space deselects blocks.
- Hovering or clicking a block again ALWAYS shows delete/duplicate.
- No runtime crashes.
- Mobile scrolling works naturally.
- Public site remains unchanged.

DELIVERABLE:
- Stable admin editor with predictable block actions and simplified UX.
