Implement year-based project pages with admin CMS functionality.
Design must match current cinematic subway platform concept.

GOAL:
Visitors can browse projects by year.
Only admin (me) can add/edit/delete projects via admin page.
No login required for normal visitors.

TECH STACK:
- React frontend (existing project)
- Supabase for database, auth, and storage

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

====================
1. DATA MODEL (Supabase)
====================

Create table: projects

Fields:
- id (uuid, primary key)
- year (int)
- title (text)
- thumbnail_url (text)
- video_url (text, optional)
- description (text)
- created_at (timestamp)

RLS rules:
- Public: SELECT allowed
- Authenticated users: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE allowed

====================
2. PUBLIC FLOW
====================

A. From subway homepage:
- Clicking year opens year project view (not full page reload, SPA style)
- Background subway scene remains visible

B. Year project panel:
- Glass / blur panel slides or fades in
- Grid of project cards

Card design:
- Rounded large cards
- Thumbnail image
- Title text
- Subtle hover lift

C. Card click:
- Opens modal overlay (not page change)
- Shows:
  - Embedded video (if video_url exists)
  - Large image (thumbnail)
  - Title
  - Description text
- Close button returns to year panel

====================
3. ADMIN PAGE
====================

Route: /admin

Behavior:
- Requires Supabase login
- If not logged in, show login form

Admin UI:
- Form to add new project:
  - Year (dropdown)
  - Title
  - Thumbnail upload (to Supabase Storage)
  - Video URL (optional)
  - Description textarea
  - Save button

- Project list:
  - Shows all projects
  - Edit button
  - Delete button

Editing:
- Loads project data into form
- Save updates DB

After save/delete:
- Public pages update automatically from DB

====================
4. UI STYLE RULES
====================

Must match subway cinematic theme:
- Glassmorphism panels
- Soft blur backgrounds
- Dark environment tones
- Apple-like minimal UI
- No heavy borders
- Motion easing on panels and modals

Do not redesign existing subway homepage visuals.

====================
5. ARCHITECTURE
====================

Components:
- SubwayHome (existing)
- YearProjectsPanel
- ProjectCard
- ProjectModal
- AdminLogin
- AdminDashboard
- ProjectForm

Data:
- All project data loaded from Supabase
- No hardcoded project arrays

====================
6. DO NOT IMPLEMENT YET
====================

- No SEO pages
- No server-side rendering
- No detail routing pages
- Modal only for project details

====================
FINAL REQUIREMENT

After initial coding, all future project updates must be possible
ONLY through the admin page without touching code.
