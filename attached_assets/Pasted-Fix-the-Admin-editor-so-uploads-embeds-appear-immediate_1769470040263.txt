Fix the Admin editor so uploads/embeds appear immediately WITHOUT refresh.
Currently images (non-thumbnail), grid images, and video embeds only appear after refresh or adding another block.
Implement immediate UI updates (optimistic/local state) for:
1) Image block uploads
2) Grid block image uploads
3) YouTube/Vimeo embed preview

KEEP the global Save/Unsaved workflow:
- Storage uploads can happen immediately
- DB writes to project_blocks must happen only when pressing Save

====================
A) Make blocks state the single source of truth in the editor
====================
- Maintain local state: editorBlocks (array of blocks).
- Render the canvas from editorBlocks, NOT from query data directly.
- When query loads initial blocks, set editorBlocks once.

====================
B) Image block: instant update after upload
====================
When user uploads an image for an Image block:
1) Immediately set that block into a "uploading" state in editorBlocks:
   - data.image = { url: '', uploading: true, progress?: number }
2) Call uploadImage(file, 'images')
3) On success:
   - Update editorBlocks in-place for that block id:
     data.image.url = returnedPublicUrl
     data.image.uploading = false
   - Mark editor as dirty (isDirty=true)
4) On error:
   - data.image.uploading=false
   - show inline error toast
No refetch required to see the result.

====================
C) Grid block: instant update after each file upload
====================
Grid model: data.grid = { urls: string[], columnsDesktop, columnsMobile, gap }
When user selects multiple files:
1) Immediately add temporary placeholders to urls (e.g., 'uploading:<uuid>') so user sees items appear
2) Upload files sequentially or with limited concurrency (max 2 at a time) to avoid mobile stalls
3) Replace each placeholder with the final public URL as soon as each upload finishes
4) Mark isDirty=true
No refresh/refetch required.

====================
D) Video block: instant paste + instant embedUrl + preview
====================
Video model: data.video = { originalUrl, embedUrl, aspect, lazyPreview }
- Make the input CONTROLLED (value from state).
- onChange/onPaste:
  - set originalUrl immediately in editorBlocks
  - compute embedUrl via toEmbedUrl(originalUrl)
  - set embedUrl immediately in editorBlocks
  - mark isDirty=true
Preview:
- Render iframe using embedUrl (never originalUrl).
- If lazyPreview is on, show “Load preview” button; otherwise show immediately.

====================
E) Save / Unsaved integration
====================
- Any time editorBlocks changes (image upload completed, grid urls updated, video url changed), set isDirty=true.
- Save persists BOTH:
  - project meta (title/year/cover_url)
  - blocks (upsert + delete + reorder) from editorBlocks
- After successful Save, set isDirty=false and show “Saved”.

====================
F) IMPORTANT: Do not rely on refetch to update UI
====================
- Remove patterns like "invalidateQueries to see changes" after uploads/embeds.
- Refetch is allowed only after Save, or when entering the editor.

DELIVERABLES
- Uploading images in Image block shows instantly.
- Uploading images in Grid shows instantly (progress/placeholder optional).
- Pasting YouTube/Vimeo URL updates input + embedUrl + preview instantly.
- No need to refresh or add another block to see changes.
