Improve the public project browsing UX to a Behance-style scroll detail view inside the existing overlay.
Keep the subway homepage and year transitions unchanged.

GOAL:
- "VIEW PROJECTS" opens the year project overlay (already working).
- Project cards show a clean grid.
- Clicking a card transitions to a scroll-based detail view (Behance-like) WITHIN the same overlay (no route change).
- Add polished modal interactions and responsive behavior.

REQUIREMENTS

1) Overlay / Modal UX polish
- When overlay opens: fade + slight scale-in animation.
- When overlay closes: reverse animation.
- Close methods:
  - X button (top-right)
  - Click outside the overlay (backdrop click)
  - ESC key
- When overlay is open: lock background scrolling (body overflow hidden).
- Backdrop must be slightly darkened and blurred to keep the subway visible but subdued.

2) Project Cards Grid (list view)
- Consistent thumbnail aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9) using object-fit: cover.
- Title always readable: add subtle bottom gradient overlay on thumbnail.
- Hover (desktop): slight lift + shadow + thumbnail zoom.
- Tap feedback (mobile): subtle scale or highlight.
- Responsive:
  - Desktop: 3–4 columns depending on width
  - Tablet: 2 columns
  - Mobile: 1 column with larger cards

3) In-overlay Detail View (Behance-style, scroll-based)
- On card click:
  - Transition from grid view to detail view inside the overlay (no page reload).
  - The overlay content becomes a vertical scroll page.
- Detail header:
  - Sticky top bar inside overlay with:
    - Back button: "BACK TO PROJECTS"
    - Project title
    - Close (X)
- Detail body layout:
  - Hero section at top:
    - If a video block exists: show video embed as hero
    - Otherwise: show cover image as hero
  - Then render blocks in order:
    - image block: full-width image, optional caption
    - grid block: responsive grid (2–3 columns desktop, 1–2 columns mobile)
    - text block: clean readable typography, max width, good line-height
    - video block: embedded iframe with correct responsive aspect ratio
  - Description text (if exists) should appear near the top under the title, in a readable column width.

4) Data usage
- Use existing Supabase data:
  - project list for the year from projects table
  - block content from project_blocks table
- Ensure blocks are rendered by sort_order.
- No hardcoded project arrays.

5) Performance / Quality
- Lazy-load images in the overlay.
- Preload the first visible thumbnails when opening the overlay.
- Ensure embeds and images do not overflow on mobile.

6) Do NOT change
- Subway background rendering
- Year transition overlay video logic
- Admin pages and builder

DELIVERABLE
- Updated overlay components to support two modes:
  - List mode (cards grid)
  - Detail mode (scroll page)
- Smooth transitions between modes
- Mobile-friendly layout and interactions
